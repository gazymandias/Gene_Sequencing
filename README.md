# Gene Sequencing
DNA sequencing is the process of determining the nucleic acid sequence â€“ the order of nucleotides in DNA. This code is used to determine the order of the four bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine from a DNA sample string by splitting into triplets of nucleotides called codons.
